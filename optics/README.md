# Data repository for optics configurations

Here the properties of X-ray optics like the mirror radii and angles are stored in tables with the ending ```.Wolter``` (for cone shaped optics) or ```.trueWolter```.

The files with the ending ```.rml``` contain setups including these optics and can be used to test them for example with ```restManager --c opticsBenchTrueW1.rml```.

The ```xmm_newton_angular_effective_area.csv``` file contains experimental data of an off axis experiment for the XMM optics to compare them with the simmulations.
