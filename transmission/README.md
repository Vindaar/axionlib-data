The data files found at this directory have been extracted from the [Henke database](https://henke.lbl.gov/optical_constants/).

The `.sol` file extension contains the transmission probability as a function of the energy (eV) for solid materials. The transmission defined in the file is the transmission for the following conditions.
 - Material thickness: 1um. 
 - Energy range: Between 10eV and 15keV. 
 - Density value: as defined by the Henke database.
